/**
 * Creates a zero-knowledge proof to prove that you have the pre-image of a Semaphore commitment,
 * without disclosing the actual preimage itself.
 * The use of a scope parameter along with a nullifier helps ensure the uniqueness
 * and non-reusability of the proofs, enhancing security in applications like
 * blockchain transactions or private data verification.
 * If, for example, this package were used with Semaphore to demonstrate possession
 * of a Semaphore identity of a group of voters, the scope could be the poll's ID.
 * @param privateKey The private key of the commitment.
 * @param scope A public value used to contextualize the cryptographic proof
 * and calculate the nullifier.
 * @param snarkArtifacts The Snark artifacts (wasm and zkey files) generated in
 * a trusted setup of the circuit are necessary to generate valid proofs
 * @returns The Poseidon zero-knowledge proof.
